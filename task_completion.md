# Task Completion Report

## Task: Remove routes to amazonBusiness.js

### Search Results:
- **No amazonBusiness.js file exists** in the project
- **No routes reference amazonBusiness.js** in any route files
- **No imports or requires for amazonBusiness.js** anywhere in the codebase

### Files Checked:
- server.js (main server configuration)
- routes/productSearch.js
- routes/supplier1.js
- All other files in the project using comprehensive search

### Current Route Structure:
- `/api/products` → routes/productSearch.js
- `/api/supplier1` → routes/supplier1.js

### Conclusion:
There are no routes to amazonBusiness.js to remove since no such routes exist in the codebase. The references to "Amazon Business" that do exist are related to the Amazon Business API configuration and service calls, which are legitimate parts of the application's functionality.

**Status: COMPLETED** - No action required as no amazonBusiness.js routes were found.
